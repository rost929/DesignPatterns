# Challenge SOLID, OOP, TypeScript
The goal of this challenge is to provide the team feedback to improve their skills as programmers. Therefore, the focus of this exercise is to reinforce  the following concepts:

- SOLID.
- Principles: Yagni, Dry, etc.
- Design Patterns.
- OOP
- TypeScript, always thinking that behave we have JavaScript finally, then we should be careful always at the coding time.

# Tasks:

1. Create a DevBranch from main. Try to use a clear name.
2. Download the code and open the SRC directory, you will see several design patterns (directories). You should choose one, see the URL of the documentation (before/index.ts) and start to work on it.
3. How?, Inside the BEFORE directory, you should freely try to replicate the same solution in the AFTER directory, but you have to improve the code, trying to optimize it using the challenge concepts.

Good Luck
