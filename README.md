# Challenge SOLID, OOP, TypeScript
The goal of this challenge is to provide the team feedback to improve their skills as programmers. Therefore, the focus of this exercise is to reinforce  the following concepts:

- SOLID.
- Principles: Yagni, Dry, etc.
- Design Patterns.
- OOP
- TypeScript, always thinking that behave we have JavaScript finally, then we should be careful always at the coding time.

# Tasks:

1. Create a DevBranch from main. Try to use a clear name.
2. Download the code and open the SRC directory, you will see several design patterns (directories). You should choose one, see the URL of the documentation (before/index.ts) and start to work on it.
3. How?, using the code inside the BEFORE directory, you should replicate the same solution in the AFTER directory, but you have to improve the code, trying to optimize it using the challenge concepts.

# Review

1. I will be available for any feedback.
2. You have to finish before our meeting on 17/12: Applying advanced OOP concepts.
3. We will review each solution and refactor it. 

Good Luck
